# Movie extraction from wikipedia
 I have created a module for extracting movies from the given wikipedia link along with other movie meta data.
 For collecting meta data I use tmdbv3api.
 For using this module you have to generate an api_key in TMDB webiste.
 The class is initialised by your api_key.
